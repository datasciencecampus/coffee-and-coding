# ONS Newport Coffee & Coding

A _public_ repository to hold resources and notes from ONS Coffee & Coding sessions. GitHub repository idea and layout lovingly sourced from [Department for Transport (DfT)'s repo](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/coffee-and-coding). Interested in what other Government Departments have coffee and coding? Check out the [Government RAP website](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/resource-coffee-and-coding.html).

Get in touch at: coffee.coding@ons.gov.uk, we welcome suggestions and ideas for future events.

### Contributing 
Note that resources are _publicly accessible_. When adding new content work on a branch and submit a pull request. 

Folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation

### Aim
The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at ONS. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within ONS who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other. The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the presenter/s followed by an informal Code Surgery. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding community.

### Coffee & Coding Schedule

Please note *events are restricted to ONS employees*, unless individual approval has been given. Please note that currently events are going to be held in ONS Newport without skyping to Titchfield and London, if you have any comments please get in touch.
