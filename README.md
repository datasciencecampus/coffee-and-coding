# ONS Newport Coffee & Coding

A _public_ repository to hold resources and notes from ONS Coffee & Coding sessions in Newport. GitHub repository idea and layout lovingly sourced from [Department for Transport (DfT)'s repo](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/coffee-and-coding). Interested in what other Government Departments have coffee and coding? Check out the [Government RAP website](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/resource-coffee-and-coding.html).

If you are interested in attending the London ONS Coffee and Coding please check their Github repo for more information: https://github.com/datasciencecampus/coffee-and-coding-LDN.

Get in touch at: coffee.coding@ons.gov.uk, we welcome suggestions and ideas for future events.

## Our Next Event

Our next event will be [Coffee and Coding: Turning spreadsheets into interactive web-tools](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/coffee-and-coding-turning-spreadsheets-into-interactive-web-tools-tickets-159003334253). This will take place on Thursday 24 June 2021 at 13:00-14:00.

### Turning spreadsheets into interactive web-tools

The [GSS Interactive Tools](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/dashboard/tools/home.html) are a published series of web-based tools built to improve the accessibility of official statistics and is a crucial aspect of ONS’ work in improving the coherence of official statistics from across the UK.

In this presentation, I’ll talk about how using spreadsheets for content and web-languages for templates, Python can rapidly produce web-ready products in seconds. I’ll also highlight how taking a flexible approach in designing the pipeline has paid dividends long-term by allowed the tools to grow to cover multiple thematic areas of official statistics.

Microsoft Teams will be used for this session - you will receive the link when you register for the event. 


### Code Surgery

On Wednesday 27 November 2019 we ran our first hour-long drop-in Code Surgery session in the coffee shop. 
We are planning to run further Code Surgery sessions in the future, further details will be made available near the time.

This will be an opportunity to discuss any coding problems you are having, or perhaps find better ways of solving issues. Open to coders of any level or those who have not started yet and want some guidance on how to begin. 

## Contributing
Note that resources are _publicly accessible_. When adding new content work on a branch and submit a pull request.

Folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation

## Aim
The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at ONS. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within ONS who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other. <br>The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the presenter/s followed by an informal Code Surgery. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding community.

Since there is often not enough time at the end of sessions for the Code Surgery we are considering running hour-long drop-in Code Surgeries, in the coffee shop, in addition to the presentation based monthly Coffee & Coding sessions. <br>We had our first drop-in Code Surgery on Wednesday 27 November 2019 and are planning to have the second session in January. 

## Coffee & Coding Schedule

|Fri 14 May 2021|10:00 - 11:00|Microsoft Teams|Coffee and Coding: Supervised machine learning to categorise job vacancies||Within the Advanced Analytics team at BEIS, we recently carried out a supervised machine learning project, using python, to categorise job vacancies within the Burning Glass data we have in the department into STEM PhD subjects. Along with the Longitudinal Educational Outcome data from DfE, we began analysing the supply, demand and average wages for STEM PhD graduates. In this Coffee and Coding session, we will explain the key stages within this project and the challenges we faced, as well as answer any questions you may have.|

We developed two reproducible analytical pipelines, in R and Python, in collaboration with the Best Practice and Impact team. The pipelines pick up the CSEW data, run the necessary manipulations and produce the final, fully formatted workbooks ready for publication. What previously took 13 analysts 3-weeks to produce, can now be created within an hour. We published [the tables](https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/natureofcrimetablesyearendingmarch2020) and [the code](https://github.com/ONS-centre-for-crime-and-justice) that sits behind them in September and we are keen to share our learning of RAP and working with new coding tools.|
